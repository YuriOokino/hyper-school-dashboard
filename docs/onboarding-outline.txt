	Actions & Touchpoints
	User Thoughts & Feelings
	Opportunities / UX Considerations
	1. Entry Access & Account Setup
	• User signs in via Google or enters a disposable code emailed to them.
• Guided screen: “Welcome, let’s get you started”.
• Minimal profile info (name, age/DOB, optional avatar).
	“It’s easy to get started.”
“I hope I don’t need to fill a long form.”
	Keep form minimal, auto-fill from Google when possible. Provide reassurance about data privacy.
	2. Year Assignment
	• Ask for age or DOB.
• Immediately show: “Based on your age, you’re assigned to Year …).”
• Allow manual override (e.g., for advanced students).
	“Okay, that makes sense.”
“What if I’m ahead of my year?”
	Use friendly wording. Offer override in small text link rather than heavy UI. Show how this affects course suggestions.
	3. Topic / Course-Interest Selection
	• Display multi-select tiles for subjects: e.g., Math, Science, English, Coding, Art.
• Each subject tile with icon/illustration + short description.
• CTA: “Select at least one”.
	“I like science and coding!”
“Which subjects should I pick?”
	Use colorful easily tappable cards. Possibly show “You can choose new topics next year” to reduce pressure.
	4. Placement Test for Selected Subjects
	• Based on selected topics, run one short adaptive quiz per topic.
• Show progress indicator (“Question 2 of 5”).
• At end: instant feedback and level assignment.
	“I hope it’s not too hard.”“I feel good when I finish one quiz.”
	Keep quiz light (2-3 questions each), fun rather than scary. Use positive microcopy. Consider optional skip for low friction.
	5. Personalized Course Assignment & Preview
	• Show summary: Year X, Subjects selected + levels assigned (e.g., Science – Intermediate).
• Visual roadmap or checklist (“Your learning path”), “Start Lesson 1”.
	“Great — I know what I’ll be doing.”
“This looks doable.”
	Use visual roadmap or “progress path” graphic. Make “Start” very visible. Provide optional “View full plan” for curious users.
	6. Dashboard & Onboarding Tour
	• First time on dashboard: highlight key elements (progress bar, tasks, continue button).
• Options: set weekly goal, notifications.
• CTA: “Begin your first lesson”.
	“I’m ready to learn!”
“Where do I go next?”
	Use tooltips or coach-marks for first session. Allow skip. Ensure dashboard is clean, intuitive, and visually consistent with rest of brand.
	7. Home/Routine & Future Re-Enrollment Reminder
	• Periodic access: show “Select new topics for next year” when re-enrolling.
• Provide clear reminder: “Next year you can pick new subjects”.
	“Cool — next year I can change topics.”
	Provide yearly refresh option with minimal friction. Keep returning students’ flow lighter (skip quizzes unless opted in).
